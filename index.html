			This is my profile picture for most things, it symbolises my inability to defuse the objective. 
			<br> In an older game that I played called counter strike I messed up one time and it became an inside joke with my friends, 
			<br> this is where this pictuere originated from.
			<br> Counter Strike: Global Offensive was one of my favorite games and I played it for years with my friends,
			<br> after a few years I became pretty good at around top 5% globally.
